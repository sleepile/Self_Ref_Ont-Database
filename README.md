# Ontological dataset of Self-related Studies in Neuroimaging
This dataset, compiled up to November 1, 2023, standardizes meta data extracted from neuroimaging studies that employed self-referential encoding task. In total, this dataset include 117 studies (4054 participants from 15 countries).

## Data Description
Participants (N = 4054, 2406 females) range from adolescents to the elderly. In veersion 3, we also included 1061 individuals with mental health conditions like Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, and Schizophrenia.

## Version History
- **Version 3 (Jan 22, 2024)**: Includes adolescents and elderly, enhanced disease info in the Codebook.
- **Version 2 (Nov 28, 2022)**: Adult population focus, meta-analysis of healthy subjects.
- **Version 1 (Jul 25, 2022)**: Initial operational definitions and article information.

## Software Used
- Used Endnote for literature storage and R and MATLAB R2018B for analysis (Versions 1-2).
- Used Zotero for literature organization and MATLAB R2021A for analysis (Versions 3).
